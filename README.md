# Library-Sound-Sensor-Code
Code for Arduino Library Sound Sensor. Based off of the sound sensor from the Arduino Circuit Playground, there can be three stages: quiet, loud, and disturbing. Quiet sound levels means that no light sensor goes off. Loud means that the light sensor emits a yellow color as a warning sign. Disturbing means that that the light sensor flashes red 3 times.
