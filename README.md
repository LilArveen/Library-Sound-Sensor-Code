# Library-Sound-Sensor-Code
A group project where the purpose was to incorporate the Arduino Circuit Playground and it's sensors, my team settled on creating a library sound sensor. I worked on the code aspect of the project.

Based off of the sound sensor from the Arduino Circuit Playground, there can be three stages: quiet, loud, and disturbing. Quiet sound levels means that no light sensor goes off. Loud means that the light sensor emits a yellow color as a warning sign. Disturbing means that that the light sensor flashes red 3 times.
